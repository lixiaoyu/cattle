A toy web rendering engine written in the Swift language.

After reading Matt Brubeck's (mbrubeck@limpet.net)  [Let's build a browser engine!][blog],
a series of articles about how to make you own html rendring engine.

As a swift developer, i will try to implement it in Swift language.

I'm writing this code purely for practise purposes. The goal is to create an
incomplete but extremely simple engine as a way to learn more about basic
implementation techniques.

Thanks Matt Brubeck's share about this topic. As a beginner, i can have chance to learn the browser engine "under the hood" with a good guide . 

For more details see Matt Brubeck's  github   https://github.com/mbrubeck/robinson.
